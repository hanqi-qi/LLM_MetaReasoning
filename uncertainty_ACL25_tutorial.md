# Part I
## Claim 1: Uncertainty can be used in hallucination detection

## Claim 2: Uncertainty can not be reduced by incorporating more data.

## Claim3: Uncertainty in Bayesian perspective (aleatoric uncertainty)

## Claim 4: Ensemble is a way for Uncertainty Quantification.

## Challenges & Solution : 
### 1. Granularity for uncertainty measurement (from token-level to document-level).
- propose claim-level UQ.
  


# Part II (Unsupervised UQ, information-bottleneck perspective)

## uncertainty -> entropy/likelihood

## variability of using likelihood (noisy)

  ### Solution 1: claim conditional-based probability (ignore non-important words, only sensiable words)
  ### Solution 2: Monte-Carlo estimation, multi-time sampling to calculate the entropy,but requires an additional debias term.
