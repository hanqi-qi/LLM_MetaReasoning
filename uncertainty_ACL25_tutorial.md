## Claim 1: Uncertainty can be used in hallucination detection

## Claim 2: Uncertainty can not be reduced by incorporating more data.

## Claim3: Uncertainty in Bayesian perspective (aleatoric uncertainty)

## Claim 4: Ensemble is a way for Uncertainty Quantification.

## Challenges & Solution : 
### 1. Granularity for uncertainty measurement (from token-level to document-level).
- propose claim-level UQ.
